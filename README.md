Battleship Game

Game Background:

Battleship is a two-player game where each player has a 10x10 grid playing field. This field represents a sea in which players place their ships. One aircraft carrier, one battleship, one cruiser, and two destroyers. Each type of ship is of a different size, but all ships must be placed vertically or horizontally – there is no diagonal placement of ships. The players take turns guessing grid locations of their opponent’s ships. Once all grid spaces that are occupied by a ship have been guessed, the ship sinks. The first player to sink all of the opponent’s ships wins. NOTE: This is the same background as last assignment – this is for easy reference.


Running Instruction:

1. Load the file into Eclipse.
2. If you’re testing the game in the same computer, run src/client/BattleshipClient.java twice. Else open one window in each computer.
3. Click the “Host Game” checkbox to set one window as server, then use another one to connect to this server. 
4. You will need to click the grids to place your own ships, and click start to wait for your opponent to place his ships.
5. Enjoy the game!
